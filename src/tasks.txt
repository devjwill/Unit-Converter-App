1. code breaks if you try to convert w/o changing first type first
2. condition rendering of the result
    - if text boxes are empty, nothing
    - if text is a letter instead of number, tell them it cant be converted
    - if both units are the same tell, tell them both units are the same 
    - round the decimals so they are so long, probably no longer than the thounsands place
3. make it so when you type in the second text input it also convertes instead of it being one way
