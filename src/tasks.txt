1. fill in rest of conversions for time
2. make it so changing the unit automatically changes the result instead of having to edit text inside of text box
3. condition rendering of the result
    - if text boxes are empty, nothing
    - if text is a letter instead of number, tell them it cant be converted
    - if both units are the same tell, tell them both units are the same 
    - round the decimals so they are so long, probably no longer than the thounsands place
4. make it so when you type in the second text input it also convertes instead of it being one way
